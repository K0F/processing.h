# processing.h

Single file C library that converts Processing calls into C and Raylib calls. A proof of concept, not working fully at all.

# pde2c

A little utility that converts processing pde files into C source code and executable. Using Raylib.
This in future should replace infamous Processing pre-processor, but porting code to C flawlessly. 

This is very early proof of concept. Work in progress.

## Prerequesties

 - raylib: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib

## Build
